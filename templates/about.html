    <!-- Club History and Mission -->
    <p>
        Founded in 2010, the Tech Explorers Club began as a small group of students eager to learn about the latest technologies and programming techniques. Over the years, it has grown into a vibrant community that fosters innovation, collaboration, and continuous learning.

    <p>
        Our mission is to empower students with practical tech skills and to create opportunities for personal and professional growth through hands-on projects, workshops, and networking events.
